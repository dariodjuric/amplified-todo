# Amplify to Serverless Migration Example

This is a project that shows how to migrate different aspects of an Amplify-powered backend application to Serverless Framework. It's a basic to-do application, but it doesn't have any logic implemented. It was scaffolded using Amplify's guide for [scaffolding a GraphQL project](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/overview/).

The Serverless part is in the `amplified-todo-api` folder.
